### **Key Points:**
- **Java Version Support**: From Spring Boot 2.x onwards, Java 8 and above are supported, with Spring Boot 3.x dropping support for Java 8 in favor of Java 17 and newer. Spring Boot 3.x is designed to work with Java 17+ (up to Java 23).
- **Spring Framework Compatibility**: Every Spring Boot version is tightly coupled with the corresponding version of Spring Framework. Starting from Spring Boot 3.0, the framework is upgraded to Spring 6.x, which offers better compatibility with modern Java versions (17+).
- **Servlet Containers**: Spring Boot uses embedded containers such as **Tomcat**, **Jetty**, and **Undertow**. Spring Boot 3.x versions have support for newer versions of these containers.
- **Breaking Changes**: Spring Boot 3.x introduced breaking changes primarily due to the Java 17 baseline. It requires Java 17 or later, removing support for older versions of Java and deprecated APIs.
- **Cloud-Native**: Spring Boot has added more features for cloud-native applications in newer versions (e.g., support for Kubernetes, Spring Cloud, Docker containers, and GraalVM native images).
  
### **Java 17+ Compatibility with Spring Boot**
- Starting with **Spring Boot 3.x**, only **Java 17** or higher is supported. **Spring Boot 2.x** can work with **Java 8, 11, and 17**.
- If you're working on cloud-native apps, **Spring Boot 3.x** offers the most features for containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes) and the use of **GraalVM** for native image generation.

### **Spring Boot 3.x Compatibility**
- **Spring Boot 3.0.x** (2022) dropped support for Java 8 and Java 11, introducing Java 17 as the minimum requirement. It also introduced compatibility with new versions of **Spring Data**, **Spring Security**, and **Spring Cloud**.
  
### **Deployment and Build Tools**
Spring Boot supports common **build tools** like **Maven** and **Gradle**:
- **Maven 3.6.3 or higher**
- **Gradle 7.x (7.6.4 or higher)** or **Gradle 8.x (8.4 or higher)**
  
Spring Boot provides built-in support for **embedded servlet containers** such as **Tomcat**, **Jetty**, and **Undertow** (with versions corresponding to Servlet 6.0). This allows you to easily run and deploy Spring Boot applications as standalone applications.

---

### **In Summary**
- **Spring Boot 3.x** versions support **Java 17+** and offer better integration with modern frameworks like Spring Cloud and Kubernetes.
- **Spring Boot 2.x** supports **Java 8, 11, and 17**, with significant updates for microservices architecture and cloud-native features.
- **Spring Boot 1.x** versions are suitable for legacy systems but are no longer maintained for Java 7+ applications.
