This code defines the `ExitStatus` class, which is part of the Spring Batch framework. It is a value object that represents the status of a job or step execution in a batch processing system. The class is designed to be immutable, which means once an instance is created, its state cannot be changed. This makes it thread-safe.

### Key Aspects of the `ExitStatus` Class:

1. **Exit Status Constants**:
   The class defines several predefined constant values representing different states of a job or step execution:
   - `UNKNOWN`: The state is unknown.
   - `EXECUTING`: The job or step is still running (processing).
   - `COMPLETED`: The job or step has finished successfully.
   - `NOOP`: The job or step did not perform any processing (e.g., it was already complete).
   - `FAILED`: The job or step failed.
   - `STOPPED`: The job or step was stopped before completion.

2. **Fields**:
   - `exitCode`: A string representing the exit code of the execution.
   - `exitDescription`: A string providing additional details about the exit status.

3. **Constructors**:
   - `ExitStatus(String exitCode)`: Constructor that accepts an exit code.
   - `ExitStatus(String exitCode, String exitDescription)`: Constructor that accepts both an exit code and an exit description.

4. **Methods**:
   - `getExitCode()`: Returns the exit code.
   - `getExitDescription()`: Returns the exit description.
   - `and(ExitStatus status)`: Combines the current `ExitStatus` with another, returning a new `ExitStatus`. It uses the severity of the exit codes to determine which exit code takes precedence.
   - `replaceExitCode(String code)`: Replaces the exit code with a new one and returns a new `ExitStatus`.
   - `addExitDescription(String description)`: Adds a new description to the existing one, returning a new `ExitStatus`.
   - `addExitDescription(Throwable throwable)`: Adds the stack trace of an exception to the exit description.
   - `isRunning()`: Checks if the job or step is still running (i.e., the exit code is either `EXECUTING` or `UNKNOWN`).
   - `severity(ExitStatus status)`: Returns the severity level of the exit status based on predefined codes. For example, `EXECUTING` has the highest severity, while `UNKNOWN` has the lowest.
   - `compareTo(ExitStatus status)`: Compares two `ExitStatus` objects based on their severity and exit codes.

5. **Equality and Hashing**:
   - The class overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods based on the `toString()` representation of the exit status. This ensures that two `ExitStatus` objects with the same exit code and description are considered equal.
   
6. **Stack Trace Handling**:
   - If an exception is passed to `addExitDescription()`, its stack trace is extracted and appended to the exit description. This can be useful for debugging when the job or step fails.

7. **Helper Methods**:
   - `isNonDefaultExitStatus(ExitStatus status)`: A utility method that checks if the provided exit status matches any of the known exit codes (`COMPLETED`, `EXECUTING`, `FAILED`, `NOOP`, `STOPPED`, or `UNKNOWN`).

### How It Fits in the Spring Batch Framework:
- `ExitStatus` is used in batch jobs to represent the outcome of job or step executions. It helps to track the execution state, indicating whether a step/job is running, completed, failed, etc.
- The constants (`COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `STOPPED`, etc.) help standardize the status codes across jobs and steps.
- Methods like `and()` allow combining exit statuses logically, useful when multiple steps are involved in a job and need to be aggregated into a single status.

### Usage Example:
In a batch processing job, after each step, you can check the `ExitStatus` to determine the result of that step and decide whether to proceed with the next step or handle errors appropriately.

For example:
```java
ExitStatus status = stepExecution.getExitStatus();
if (status.equals(ExitStatus.FAILED)) {
    // Handle failure case
}
```

In summary, the `ExitStatus` class is a core component in the Spring Batch framework for tracking and handling the state of job or step executions. Its immutability and thread-safety make it a reliable choice for concurrent processing scenarios.
