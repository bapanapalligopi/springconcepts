You're asking about different `PasswordEncoder` implementations provided by Spring Security. Let's break down the major ones you highlighted in your image and explain their use cases and security levels.

---

## 🔐 Common Spring `PasswordEncoder` Implementations

### ✅ 1. `BCryptPasswordEncoder` – **Recommended**

* **Algorithm:** BCrypt
* **Strength:** Very strong, adaptive (you can increase the work factor)
* **Usage:** Default choice for most secure systems
* **Salted:** Yes (internal random salt)
* **Good for:** Web apps, production-grade applications

```java
auth.jdbcAuthentication()
    .dataSource(dataSource)
    .passwordEncoder(new BCryptPasswordEncoder());
```

---

### ✅ 2. `SCryptPasswordEncoder`

* **Algorithm:** SCrypt (even stronger than BCrypt)
* **Strength:** Designed to be expensive in both time and memory (harder for brute-force attacks)
* **Usage:** Great for very high-security applications
* **Slower than BCrypt**, but more secure in theory

```java
new SCryptPasswordEncoder();
```

---

### ✅ 3. `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder`

* **Algorithm:** PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)
* **Strength:** Used in many enterprise systems, flexible parameters
* **Configurable:** iteration count, salt size, etc.
* **Good for:** Systems needing FIPS compliance

```java
new Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder();
```

---

### ⚠️ 4. `NoOpPasswordEncoder` – **Not secure**

* **Behavior:** Stores passwords in plain text
* **Use:** ONLY for testing or demos
* **Never use in production!**

```java
NoOpPasswordEncoder.getInstance();
```

---

### ⚠️ 5. `Md4PasswordEncoder`, `MessageDigestPasswordEncoder` – **Obsolete**

* **Hash Algorithms:** MD4, SHA-1, MD5
* **Outdated & Insecure**
* **Use only if integrating with legacy systems (not recommended)**

---

### ✅ 6. `DelegatingPasswordEncoder` – **Smart Wrapper**

* **Use case:** Supports multiple encoders (backward compatibility)
* **Example:** Passwords stored in DB as `{bcrypt}$2a$10$...` or `{noop}plain`
* Spring matches the prefix and applies the right encoder

```java
PasswordEncoder encoder = PasswordEncoderFactories.createDelegatingPasswordEncoder();
```

> 🔹 Highly recommended when migrating from older hash algorithms (e.g., from MD5 to BCrypt)

---

### ✅ 7. `StandardPasswordEncoder` – **SHA-256-based**

* Older implementation using SHA-256 with salt
* Better than `NoOp`, worse than `BCrypt`
* Deprecated in newer Spring versions

### 🧠 Summary Table

| Encoder                     | Secure | Salted | Recommended?          |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------ | --------------------- |
| `BCryptPasswordEncoder`     | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Best for most apps  |
| `SCryptPasswordEncoder`     | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Strongest (slow)    |
| `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder`     | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Good for FIPS       |
| `DelegatingPasswordEncoder` | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Flexible, smart use |
| `NoOpPasswordEncoder`       | ❌ No   | ❌ No   | ❌ Never in production |
| `Md4`, `MessageDigest`      | ❌ No   | ❌ No   | ❌ Deprecated          |

### 💡 Your Code Sample Explained:

```java
auth.jdbcAuthentication()
    .dataSource(datasource)
    .passwordEncoder(bcryptPasswordEncoder);
```

This configures Spring to:

* Load users from a **database**
* Use **BCrypt** to validate passwords
* Compare login input (after BCrypt hash) with DB values
