### What is JUnit?
JUnit is a testing framework for Java that is used to write and run repeatable tests. It is primarily used to verify that individual units of code (such as methods or classes) work as expected.

- **JUnit is a framework**: It provides a set of tools to write and run tests for Java applications.
- **Used for unit testing**: It helps in testing individual parts of the code (methods or functions).
- **Repeatable tests**: Tests can be run multiple times to ensure that changes don't break existing functionality.

### How JUnit Works?
- **Write the method**: The first step is to write the method that you want to test. This method will be placed under a test class.
- **Annotate with `@Test`**: After writing the method, we annotate the testing method with the `@Test` annotation. This lets JUnit know that this method should be treated as a test.
- **Assertions**: JUnit provides assertion methods like `assertEquals()`, `assertTrue()`, `assertFalse()`, etc., to check whether the actual results match the expected results.
- **Test Runners**: JUnit test runners are responsible for executing the tests and reporting the results. JUnit supports integration with IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and build tools like Maven and Gradle.

In JUnit:
- **Java code**: Refers to the class you are testing.
- **Unit test**: The test cases you write using JUnit framework to test the Java code.
- **Test runners**: Tools in JUnit that execute the test cases and report the outcome.

### Key Features of JUnit
- **Annotations**: JUnit uses annotations like `@Test`, `@Before`, `@After` to make test management easier.
- **Assertions**: Assertions are used to check whether the results are as expected.
- **Test Runners**: Test runners are responsible for executing the tests and reporting results.
- **Integration**: JUnit integrates well with build tools like Maven and Gradle.

### JUnit Basic Concepts
1. **System Under Test (SUT)**: The class or system you want to test.
2. **Method Under Test**: The method or function in the class that you are testing.

The "method under test" refers to the actual method that you want to verify using assertions. 

- **Test Class**: A normal Java class that contains multiple test methods. Every method in this class is annotated with `@Test`.
- **Test Method**: A method in the test class that contains code to test a particular method or function in the class being tested.
- **Assertions**: Assertions are used in test methods to check whether the results match the expected values. Some of the most commonly used assertions are:
  - `assertEquals()`
  - `assertTrue()`
  - `assertFalse()`
  - `assertThrows()`
  
- **Test Runner**: The test runner is responsible for executing the test methods in the test class and reporting the results. Test runners can be configured to run tests in specific environments and report detailed test results.

### Setting Up Environment for JUnit
1. **Create a Maven Project**: If you're using Maven, you need to add JUnit dependencies to your `pom.xml` file to enable JUnit in your project.
2. **Add Dependencies**: Below is an example of how to add the JUnit 5 dependency to your Maven project:

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
    <version>5.11.3</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

This dependency allows you to use JUnit in your project, which is required for writing and running tests.

### `@Test` Annotation
The `@Test` annotation is used to mark a method as a test case in JUnit. When a method is annotated with `@Test`, JUnit recognizes it as a test method that should be executed. 

- **Marks the method as a test**: By annotating a method with `@Test`, you are indicating that this method is a test case.
- **JUnit automatically runs methods annotated with `@Test`**: Once a method is annotated, the JUnit test runner will automatically execute it when you run the tests.
- **Visibility**: In JUnit 5, test methods annotated with `@Test` can be public, protected, or package-private (default), but they cannot be private.
- **Return Type**: Test methods should have a `void` return type. They do not return any values.
- **Failure**: If the test fails, an `AssertionError` is thrown, and JUnit reports that the actual result does not match the expected result.

### Example Code with JUnit

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.add(5, 3);
        assertEquals(8, result, "Addition result should be 8");
    }
}
```

In this example:
- We have a method `testAdd()` that tests the `add()` method of a `Calculator` class.
- The `assertEquals()` assertion is used to verify that the result of the `add(5, 3)` method call is equal to `8`.
