Absolutely! Let’s go **deeper into `@RepeatedTest`** in **JUnit 5**, covering everything from syntax, customization, use cases, test output behavior, and best practices — all with clear examples. Let's level up your understanding 💡

---

## 🔁 `@RepeatedTest` — In Depth

---

### 🔹 1. What is `@RepeatedTest`?

`@RepeatedTest` is a JUnit 5 annotation that allows you to **run a test method multiple times** automatically.  
Each repetition is **independent**, and the same test logic is executed **N times**.

---

### 🔹 2. Syntax

```java
@RepeatedTest(value = 5)
void myRepeatedTest() {
    // runs 5 times
}
```

You can also specify a **custom display name**:

```java
@RepeatedTest(value = 5, name = "Run {currentRepetition} of {totalRepetitions}")
void repeatedWithName() {
    // Output: Run 1 of 5, Run 2 of 5, etc.
}
```

---

### 🔹 3. `RepetitionInfo` – Access Repetition Data

You can inject `RepetitionInfo` into your test method to access:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `getCurrentRepetition()` | Returns the current repetition number (1-based). |
| `getTotalRepetitions()` | Returns how many total repetitions were defined. |

📌 Example:

```java
@RepeatedTest(3)
void testWithRepetitionInfo(RepetitionInfo repetitionInfo) {
    System.out.println("Repetition " + repetitionInfo.getCurrentRepetition() +
                       " of " + repetitionInfo.getTotalRepetitions());
}
```

---

### 🔹 4. Use Cases

| Use Case | Why Use `@RepeatedTest` |
|----------|--------------------------|
| 🔁 **Stability testing** | Ensure methods behave the same across multiple runs. |
| 🎲 **Random logic** | Test logic that depends on randomness. |
| ⚙️ **Concurrency testing** | Simulate multiple access attempts. |
| 🧪 **Flaky tests** | Detect unreliable test behavior by running them repeatedly. |
| ⏱️ **Performance/Stress test** | Run lightweight stress tests (to an extent). |

---

### 🔹 5. Example – Testing Random Output

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.RepeatedTest;

class RandomTest {

    @RepeatedTest(5)
    void testRandomNumberIsWithinRange() {
        int random = (int) (Math.random() * 10); // 0 to 9
        System.out.println("Random value: " + random);
        assert random >= 0 && random < 10;
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 6. Example – With Setup & Teardown

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_METHOD)
class AdvancedRepeatedTest {

    @BeforeEach
    void setup() {
        System.out.println("Setting up...");
    }

    @RepeatedTest(value = 3, name = "Test repetition {currentRepetition} of {totalRepetitions}")
    void repeatTest(RepetitionInfo info) {
        System.out.println("Running test #" + info.getCurrentRepetition());
    }

    @AfterEach
    void teardown() {
        System.out.println("Cleaning up...");
    }
}
```

🟢 Output will show that `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` are called **before and after every repetition**.

---

### ✅ Advantages

- Easy way to repeat tests.
- Detects flaky or intermittent bugs.
- Good for testing randomness, concurrency, or boundary cases repeatedly.

---

### ❌ Disadvantages

- Not suitable for heavy performance testing (JUnit isn't optimized for benchmarking).
- If a test fails in one repetition, all others may still pass, which can confuse debugging.
- Can make your test output noisy.

---

### 🧠 Best Practices

- Combine with `RepetitionInfo` for custom logic inside repetitions.
- Use clear naming (`name = ...`) to help understand which repetition failed.
- Don’t overuse it unless repetition is needed — it slows down test runs.

---

### 🎯 When Should You Use `@RepeatedTest`?

| Scenario | Use It? |
|----------|---------|
| Testing unstable/random code | ✅ Yes |
| Validating consistency over multiple runs | ✅ Yes |
| Performance benchmarking | ❌ No (use tools like JMH) |
| UI or integration testing | ⚠️ Maybe (depends on use case) |
